# React + Vite

----- Wear Share -----

Hello Star,

This repository is all about front-end. It is built using React + Vite.

The major idea is to connect the donors to NGOs. Lots of old items such as stationaries, clothes, foot wears, etc that is might not usefull for us but it can be for someone. NGOs finds someone & this web app connects NGOs to donors.

Work flow :

-> Donor lis the items on site, NGOs see listed items & make request for it.
-> Donor select the request from different factors like location, NGOs raviews, etc.
-> After confirm the NGO for donation, one volunteer either from NGO or any social worker get the items from Donor & carry it to NGO. such way anyone can also contribute & do social service.
-> At last NGO distribute the collected items.

One last but not least feature : --> NGO upload picture of distributed item, so that donor can see that their donation is on right hands
