# React + Vite

----- Wear Share -----

Hello Star,

This repository is all about front-end. It is built using React + Vite.

The major idea is to connect the donors to NGOs. Lots of used or new items such as stationaries, clothes, foot wears, etc that is might not usefull for us but it can be for someone. NGOs finds someone & this web app connects NGOs to donors.

-->>Work flow & fetures:

-> Donor lis the items on site, NGOs see listed items & make request for it.
-> Donor select the request from different factors like location, NGOs raviews, etc.
-> After confirm the NGO for donation, one volunteer either from NGO or any social worker get the items from Donor & carry it to NGO. such way anyone can also contribute & do social service.
-> At last NGO distribute the collected items.

One last but not least feature : --> NGO upload picture of distributed item, so that donor can see that their donation is on right hands.

-->>Modules :

-> Every module has its own Dashboard, which includes slightly different features according to user. Admin has more feature compare to other, Admin can see list of donors, NGOs, volunteers.

 1) Donor : -> The donor module lets user register as donor & upload the used or new items
            -> App lets donor decide which NGO they want to send items.
            -> Donor see the total donation, monthly donation.
            -> Donor can also able to his past history.
            -> NGO also able to see status of donation. { Pending, picked up, In route, Delivered, Picture Uploaded }
    
 2) NGO : -> The Ngo can see the listed donations on site & if it is on their area they make an request for it.
          -> NGO also able to see status of donation.
          -> NGO has to upload picture of distributed items, so doners can see their donation goes to needy one.

 3) Volunteer : -> They are helpful to picked up & deliver the items.
                -> When donor accept NGO request the tranfer request goes in Volunteer home.
                -> If Volunteer see the route that match their regular route or want to do social service, he/she can accept the mission & deliver items to NGO.
                -> Volunteer can be anyone, eithe NGO hire them or any social worker who want to contribute to this mission.

 4) Admin : -> Admin can see the All donations.
            -> Also if someone either donor, NGO or volunteer might cause some issue, Admin has rights to remove that user.
